            <!-- When to Contact Us -->
            <h2>When to Contact Us</h2>

            <p>We receive a wide range of inquiries from cybersecurity professionals, business owners, IT administrators, students, and curious individuals who want to learn more about protecting their digital assets. To help you understand whether reaching out is the right step, here is a detailed overview of the types of inquiries we handle and how we can assist with each one.</p>

            <h3>Security Assessment Questions</h3>
            <p>If you have used one of our assessment tools or read through our security scoring methodology and have questions about your results, our team can help you interpret findings, understand risk ratings, and prioritize remediation efforts. We frequently assist organizations that have completed an initial assessment and need guidance on which vulnerabilities to address first, how to allocate security budgets effectively, and what benchmarks to measure progress against. Whether your score surprised you or confirmed your suspicions, we can provide the context you need to move forward with confidence.</p>

            <h3>Compliance Guidance</h3>
            <p>Navigating the complex landscape of regulatory compliance can be overwhelming, especially for organizations that must adhere to multiple frameworks simultaneously. Our team can provide guidance on understanding requirements for <strong>SOC 2</strong>, <strong>ISO 27001</strong>, <strong>GDPR</strong>, <strong>HIPAA</strong>, <strong>PCI DSS</strong>, and other major compliance standards. We help clarify which frameworks apply to your specific industry and geography, what controls you need to implement, and how to prepare for formal audits. While we do not perform certification audits ourselves, we can point you toward the right resources and help you build a roadmap for achieving and maintaining compliance.</p>

            <h3>Content Suggestions and Corrections</h3>
            <p>Our educational content is the backbone of MySecurity Scores, and we take accuracy and relevance extremely seriously. If you spot an error in one of our guides, notice outdated information that needs updating, or have a topic suggestion that you believe would benefit our community, we want to hear from you. Our editorial team reviews all content suggestions and corrections promptly. Many of our most popular guides were inspired by reader requests, so do not hesitate to share your ideas. We also welcome guest contributions from qualified cybersecurity professionals who want to share their expertise with our audience.</p>

            <h3>Vulnerability Reporting</h3>
            <p>If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our platform, website, or any of our tools, we strongly encourage you to report it through our responsible disclosure process outlined in detail below. Security researchers play a vital role in keeping the internet safe, and we treat every vulnerability report with the seriousness and urgency it deserves. Our security team reviews all reports within 24 hours and will work with you to understand, reproduce, and remediate the issue as quickly as possible.</p>

            <h3>General Cybersecurity Inquiries</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you just need a knowledgeable person to point you in the right direction. Whether you are a small business owner wondering where to start with cybersecurity, a student researching topics for a thesis, or an IT professional looking for a second opinion on a security architecture decision, we are happy to help. While we cannot provide exhaustive consulting services through our free support channel, we can offer general guidance, recommend relevant resources from our library, and connect you with specialized services when your needs go beyond what our educational platform covers.</p>

            <!-- Response Time Expectations -->
            <h2>Response Time Expectations</h2>

            <p>We understand that when you take the time to contact us, you expect a prompt and meaningful response. Transparency is one of our core values, so here is exactly what you can expect after submitting an inquiry through any of our channels.</p>

            <p><strong>General Inquiries (24 to 48 hours):</strong> Most support requests, content questions, and general cybersecurity inquiries receive a response within one to two business days. During periods of high volume, response times may extend slightly, but we always aim to acknowledge receipt of your message within 24 hours even if a complete answer requires additional time. If your question is complex and requires research or consultation with a specialist, we will let you know the expected timeline for a comprehensive response.</p>

            <p><strong>Security Concerns (Priority Handling):</strong> Any inquiry related to a security vulnerability, active threat, or urgent security matter is automatically escalated to our security team. These reports are triaged within hours, not days. If you are reporting a vulnerability in our platform, you can expect an initial acknowledgment within 12 hours and a substantive response regarding the status of your report within 48 hours. For reports involving active exploitation or critical severity issues, our team is available around the clock.</p>

            <p><strong>Partnership and Consulting (3 to 5 Business Days):</strong> Partnership proposals and consulting requests undergo a more thorough review process because they often involve multiple stakeholders on our end. After receiving your inquiry, our business development team will evaluate the opportunity, discuss it internally, and prepare a tailored response. We aim to provide an initial reply within three to five business days, though more complex proposals may require additional time. If we need more information from you to evaluate your request, we will reach out promptly to keep the process moving.</p>

            <p><strong>Media Requests (24 Hours):</strong> We understand that journalists and content creators often work on tight deadlines. Our media team prioritizes press inquiries and aims to respond within 24 hours. If you have a time-sensitive request, please mention your deadline in the subject line of your email, and we will make every effort to provide commentary or data within your required timeframe.</p>

            <div class="info-box important">
                <div class="info-box-title">Important Note About Response Times</div>
                <p>Response times listed above reflect business days (Monday through Friday, excluding major holidays). Messages received over weekends or holidays will be processed on the next business day. If your matter is genuinely urgent and involves an active security threat, please indicate this clearly in your subject line, and our on-call team will review it outside normal business hours.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure -->
            <h2>Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>

            <p>At MySecurity Scores, we take the security of our own platform just as seriously as we take educating others about security. We recognize that independent security researchers are essential partners in identifying vulnerabilities that automated systems might miss, and we are committed to working collaboratively with the security community to keep our platform and our users safe.</p>

            <p>If you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in any MySecurity Scores property, including our website, assessment tools, APIs, or infrastructure, we ask that you follow our responsible disclosure process. This ensures that issues are addressed before they can be exploited, protecting both our users and the broader community.</p>

            <h3>How to Report a Vulnerability</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Document the Issue:</strong> Before contacting us, please gather as much information as possible about the vulnerability. Include the affected URL or endpoint, a step-by-step description of how to reproduce the issue, the potential impact of the vulnerability, and any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that demonstrate the problem. The more detail you provide, the faster our security team can triage and address the issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Send Your Report:</strong> Email your findings to <strong>security@mysecurityscores.com</strong> with the subject line formatted as "Vulnerability Report: [Brief Description]". If you wish to encrypt your communication, our PGP public key is available on our security page. We accept reports in any reasonable format, but structured reports using a template like the one suggested by OWASP are especially helpful.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow Time for Remediation:</strong> After we acknowledge your report, please give our team a reasonable window to investigate and remediate the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We typically request a minimum of 90 days for critical issues and 30 days for lower-severity findings. We will keep you informed of our progress throughout this period.</li>
                <li><strong>Coordinate Disclosure:</strong> Once the vulnerability has been patched and deployed, we will coordinate with you on any public disclosure. We believe in transparency and are happy to credit researchers who help us improve our security, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What We Ask of Researchers</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to other users during your testing.</li>
                <li>Do not perform denial-of-service attacks or any testing that could degrade service for our users.</li>
                <li>Do not use automated vulnerability scanners on our production environment without prior written approval.</li>
                <li>Act in good faith and make every effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction.</li>
                <li>Report vulnerabilities exclusively to our security team and avoid public disclosure until remediation is complete.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Commitment to Researchers</h3>

            <p>We pledge to acknowledge your report within 12 hours, provide regular status updates as we work on remediation, not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith and comply with this policy, credit you publicly in our security acknowledgments page (if desired), and treat your report with the confidentiality and seriousness it deserves. We value the contributions of the security research community and view vulnerability reports as an essential component of our overall security posture.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Our editorial team reviews and updates content on a continuous basis. Major guides and frameworks are comprehensively updated at least quarterly to reflect changes in the threat landscape, new compliance requirements, and evolving best practices. When significant cybersecurity events occur, such as the disclosure of a major vulnerability or a change in regulatory requirements, we publish updates within days. Each article displays a "last updated" date so you can assess the currency of the information. We also have an active content review pipeline that systematically rotates through our entire library to ensure nothing becomes stale.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Our security assessments are designed to provide a reliable, high-level overview of an organization's security posture based on publicly observable data and industry-standard evaluation criteria. While no automated assessment can replace a comprehensive manual penetration test or a full security audit, our tools are built on methodologies aligned with frameworks like NIST, OWASP, and CIS Controls. We continuously refine our scoring algorithms based on the latest threat intelligence and feedback from security professionals. For the most accurate results, we recommend using our assessments as a starting point and complementing them with professional security reviews for critical systems.</p>

            <!-- Our Office & Support Hours -->
            <h2>Our Office and Support Hours</h2>

            <p>MySecurity Scores operates as a distributed team with members across multiple time zones, which allows us to provide broader coverage than a single-location operation. Our primary support and operational hours are as follows.</p>

            <p><strong>Standard Support Hours:</strong> Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM Eastern Time (ET / UTC-5). During these hours, all support channels are fully staffed, and response times are at their fastest. Most inquiries submitted during standard hours receive a response the same business day.</p>

            <p><strong>Extended Coverage:</strong> Our team members in other time zones often handle inquiries outside of standard Eastern Time hours. While we do not guarantee same-day responses for messages received outside standard hours, many inquiries are addressed during our extended coverage window of 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM ET on weekdays.</p>

            <p><strong>Weekend and Holiday Coverage:</strong> Our support channels are monitored on a limited basis during weekends and major holidays. Non-urgent inquiries received during these periods will be addressed on the next business day. Security vulnerability reports and urgent security matters are monitored continuously, including weekends and holidays, through our on-call rotation.</p>

            <p><strong>Scheduled Maintenance:</strong> Occasionally, we perform scheduled maintenance on our platform, typically during low-traffic hours (Saturday or Sunday, 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM ET). During maintenance windows, our assessment tools and some interactive features may be temporarily unavailable, but all educational content remains accessible. We announce planned maintenance at least 48 hours in advance through our status page and social media channels.</p>

            <div class="info-box note">
                <div class="info-box-title">Holiday Schedule</div>
                <p>Our office observes major United States holidays, including New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Support tickets submitted on holidays will be processed on the next business day. For a current list of upcoming holiday closures, check our status page.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Community & Social -->
            <h2>Community and Social</h2>

We maintain an active presence across several platforms where we share cybersecurity insights, platform updates, new guide announcements, and real-time commentary on emerging threats. Following us on social media is the fastest way to stay informed about new content, security advisories, and community events.</p>

            <p>You can find us on major social media platforms where we share daily cybersecurity tips, breaking security news analysis, new guide announcements, community polls, and discussions about current threats and best practices. Our social channels are also a great way to ask quick questions, share feedback, and connect with other security-minded professionals in our growing community.</p>

            <p>We also publish a <strong>monthly newsletter</strong> that curates the best of our new content, highlights industry developments, and provides exclusive insights from our consulting team. The newsletter is free, contains no spam, and includes an easy unsubscribe option in every issue. You can sign up through the subscription form on our homepage.</p>

            <p>For organizations and individuals who want to engage more deeply with our platform, we host periodic <strong>webinars and virtual events</strong> on topics ranging from compliance deep-dives to threat landscape briefings. These events are free to attend and often include Q&amp;A sessions with our cybersecurity experts.
