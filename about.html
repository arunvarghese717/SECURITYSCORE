            <!-- Section: Mission & Vision -->
            <h2 id="mission-vision">Our Mission &amp; Vision</h2>

            <p>At MySecurity Scores, our mission is to <strong>democratize cybersecurity knowledge</strong> and make enterprise-grade security education accessible to every business, regardless of size, industry, or budget. We believe that strong cybersecurity should not be a luxury reserved for large corporations with dedicated security operations centers and seven-figure budgets. Every organization, from a two-person startup to a mid-market enterprise, deserves access to the same caliber of security guidance that Fortune 500 companies rely on to protect their digital assets, customer data, and operational integrity.</p>

            <p>Our vision extends beyond simply publishing articles and guides. We are building a <strong>comprehensive cybersecurity education ecosystem</strong> that empowers business owners, IT administrators, developers, and decision-makers to understand, evaluate, and improve their security posture through actionable, evidence-based resources. We envision a world where no business falls victim to a preventable cyberattack because the knowledge to defend against it was locked behind expensive consulting fees or impenetrable technical jargon.</p>

            <p>The cybersecurity landscape of 2026 is more treacherous than ever before. Ransomware attacks have escalated in both frequency and sophistication, supply chain compromises threaten organizations through their trusted vendors, and AI-powered threats are evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. In this environment, education is not merely helpful; it is an essential component of every organization's defense strategy. MySecurity Scores exists to ensure that this critical education reaches the people who need it most.</p>

            <p>We measure our success not by pageviews or revenue, but by the tangible security improvements our readers achieve after implementing the guidance we provide. Every assessment completed, every vulnerability patched, and every compliance gap closed as a result of our content represents a small victory in the broader effort to make the internet a safer place for businesses and their customers alike.</p>

            <!-- Section: Why We Exist -->
            <h2 id="why-we-exist">Why MySecurity Scores Exists</h2>

            <p>The genesis of MySecurity Scores stems from a fundamental problem that persists across the cybersecurity industry: <strong>cybersecurity is confusing, expensive, and inaccessible for small and medium-sized businesses</strong>. Despite being the most targeted segment by cybercriminals, SMBs consistently face the highest barriers to implementing effective security measures. According to industry research, nearly 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses, yet only 14% of those businesses consider themselves prepared to defend against such threats. This gap between risk exposure and readiness is the problem we set out to solve.</p>

            <p>The traditional cybersecurity consulting model is fundamentally broken for smaller organizations. A standard penetration test can cost between $10,000 and $100,000. Compliance audits for frameworks like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 can run into the tens of thousands of dollars before an organization even begins implementing the required controls. For a business operating on thin margins, these costs are prohibitive, and the consequence is that security becomes an afterthought rather than a priority. MySecurity Scores bridges this gap by providing the <strong>knowledge, frameworks, and assessment tools</strong> that enable organizations to take meaningful action on their own, without requiring an enterprise-scale budget.</p>

            <p>Beyond cost, the cybersecurity industry suffers from a severe communication problem. Security documentation, vendor whitepapers, and compliance standards are often written by and for specialists, using terminology and assumptions that alienate the very people who need the information most. A business owner searching for guidance on whether they need SOC 2 or ISO 27001 certification should not need a CISSP credential to understand the answer. We translate complex security concepts into <strong>clear, actionable guidance</strong> that respects our readers' intelligence while acknowledging that cybersecurity may not be their primary area of expertise.</p>

            <div class="info-box note">
                <div class="info-box-title">Our Commitment</div>
                <p>We are committed to keeping our core educational content permanently free. We believe that basic cybersecurity knowledge is a public good, and restricting access to it based on ability to pay ultimately makes the entire digital ecosystem less secure for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Section: Our Approach -->
            <h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach to Cybersecurity Education</h2>

            <p>Creating cybersecurity content that is simultaneously accurate, accessible, and actionable requires a disciplined editorial process. At MySecurity Scores, we do not publish content based on trends, hunches, or marketing agendas. Every piece of educational material on our platform is <strong>research-backed, peer-reviewed, and updated on a quarterly cycle</strong> to ensure it reflects the current threat landscape and the latest developments in security frameworks, compliance requirements, and best practices.</p>

            <p>Our content creation process begins with <strong>primary research</strong>. Before writing a single word, our editorial team consults authoritative sources including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications, Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines, SANS Institute research papers, Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks, and MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework documentation. We cross-reference vendor-independent research from organizations like the Ponemon Institute, Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advisories to ensure our recommendations are grounded in empirical data rather than vendor marketing.</p>

            <p>Once drafted, every guide undergoes a <strong>multi-stage review process</strong>. Technical accuracy is verified by team members with hands-on experience in the relevant domain, whether that is network security, application security, compliance auditing, or incident response. Readability is assessed to ensure that concepts are explained at an appropriate level for our target audience without sacrificing precision. Finally, guides are tested for actionability: we verify that the steps and recommendations we provide can realistically be implemented by the types of organizations our readers represent.</p>

            <p>Our quarterly update cycle is not a cosmetic exercise. Every guide is re-evaluated against the current threat landscape, and we actively track changes to the frameworks and standards we reference. When NIST releases an update to the Cybersecurity Framework, when OWASP publishes a new Top 10 list, or when a significant vulnerability is discovered that affects the technologies our readers use, we update our content accordingly. Each guide includes a visible <strong>last-updated date</strong> so readers always know how current the information is.</p>

            <!-- Section: What We Offer -->
            <h2 id="what-we-offer">What We Offer</h2>

            <p>MySecurity Scores provides a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity education resources designed to address the full spectrum of security challenges businesses face in 2026. Our offerings are structured to guide organizations from initial awareness through implementation and ongoing improvement.</p>

            <h3>Security Assessments</h3>
            <p>Our <strong>free security assessment tools</strong> provide organizations with an immediate, actionable snapshot of their security posture. Unlike superficial security scanners that generate long lists of technical vulnerabilities without context, our assessments evaluate security holistically, examining technical controls, policies, procedures, and organizational readiness. Each assessment generates a prioritized remediation roadmap that tells you not just what needs fixing, but which fixes will have the greatest impact on reducing your overall risk profile. Our assessments cover web application security, network infrastructure, email security configuration, and cloud environment hardening.</p>

            <h3>Compliance Guides</h3>
            <p>Navigating the compliance landscape is one of the most daunting challenges for growing businesses. Our <strong>compliance guides</strong> demystify frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR by breaking them down into plain-language explanations with practical implementation steps. We provide side-by-side comparisons to help organizations determine which certifications are relevant to their industry and customer base, along with realistic timelines and budget estimates for achieving compliance. Each guide includes checklists, gap analysis templates, and links to the authoritative source documents.</p>

            <h3>Threat Intelligence Reports</h3>
            <p>Our <strong>threat intelligence resources</strong> translate the complex world of emerging cyber threats into clear briefings that business leaders and IT teams can act on. We monitor threat feeds, track active campaigns, and analyze trends in the threat landscape to provide timely, relevant intelligence about the risks most likely to affect our readers. Our reports cover ransomware trends, phishing campaign patterns, supply chain attack vectors, zero-day vulnerability disclosures, and emerging attack techniques documented in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework.</p>

            <h3>Security Frameworks Comparison</h3>
            <p>Choosing the right security framework can be overwhelming when there are dozens of options, each with different scopes, requirements, and implementation costs. Our <strong>frameworks comparison resources</strong> provide detailed analyses of leading frameworks including NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CIS Controls, ISO 27001, COBIT, and the NIST Risk Management Framework. We map controls across frameworks to help organizations that need to satisfy multiple compliance requirements simultaneously, reducing duplication of effort and streamlining implementation.</p>

            <h3>Best Practices Library</h3>
            <p>Our <strong>best practices library</strong> is an ever-growing collection of implementation guides covering specific security domains. From configuring email authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to implementing zero-trust architecture principles, each guide provides step-by-step instructions with configuration examples, common pitfalls to avoid, and verification steps to confirm correct implementation. These guides are designed to be followed by IT administrators and developers without requiring specialized security expertise.</p>

            <h3>Interactive Security Tools</h3>
            <p>We develop and maintain a suite of <strong>interactive browser-based security tools</strong> that allow users to evaluate specific aspects of their security posture in real time. Our password strength analyzer helps users understand the actual entropy and crack-resistance of their passwords. Our SSL/TLS configuration checker evaluates certificate chains and cipher suite configurations. Our security header analyzer examines HTTP response headers against best-practice recommendations. All tools run entirely in the browser, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the user's device.</p>

            <h3>Incident Response Planning</h3>
            <p>When a security incident occurs, the speed and effectiveness of the response can mean the difference between a minor disruption and a catastrophic breach. Our <strong>incident response planning resources</strong> provide templates, playbooks, and step-by-step guides for building and testing an incident response capability. We cover the complete incident response lifecycle as defined by NIST SP 800-61: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity. Our templates are designed to be customized to each organization's specific environment and risk profile.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Security Guidance</h3>
            <p>As organizations increasingly migrate workloads to cloud environments, the security challenges they face evolve accordingly. Our <strong>cloud security resources</strong> address the unique risks and configuration challenges of major cloud platforms. We cover identity and access management, network segmentation, data encryption, logging and monitoring, and compliance in cloud environments. Our guides address the shared responsibility model and help organizations understand exactly where the cloud provider's security obligations end and their own begin.</p>

            <!-- Section: Editorial Standards -->
            <h2 id="editorial-standards">Our Editorial Standards</h2>

            <p>The credibility of our platform depends entirely on the <strong>accuracy, objectivity, and timeliness</strong> of the content we publish. We maintain rigorous editorial standards that govern every piece of content from initial research through publication and ongoing maintenance. These standards are not aspirational guidelines; they are mandatory requirements that every contributor and reviewer must follow.</p>

            <p>Our primary sources are <strong>authoritative, vendor-neutral organizations</strong> with established track records in cybersecurity research and standards development. These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which publishes the Cybersecurity Framework, Special Publications 800 series, and risk management guidelines; the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which maintains the OWASP Top 10 and Application Security Verification Standard; the SANS Institute, which publishes original research and maintains the Critical Security Controls; and the MITRE Corporation, which develops and maintains the ATT&amp;CK framework used by security teams worldwide to understand adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p>

            <p>We maintain strict <strong>editorial independence</strong> from vendors and service providers. Our recommendations are based on technical merit, empirical evidence, and alignment with established security frameworks, not on advertising relationships or affiliate revenue. When we reference specific products or services, we do so because they represent well-established categories of security tools, not because of any commercial arrangement. If we ever introduce sponsored content in the future, it will be clearly and prominently labeled as such, and it will never influence our editorial recommendations.</p>

            <p>Every guide published on MySecurity Scores undergoes the following editorial process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Research Phase:</strong> Primary sources are identified and consulted. The current state of the relevant framework, standard, or technology is verified against the most recent authoritative publications.</li>
                <li><strong>Drafting Phase:</strong> Content is written following our style guide, which mandates clear language, proper heading hierarchy, accurate use of technical terminology, and inclusion of actionable steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Review:</strong> A team member with domain-specific expertise reviews the draft for technical accuracy, verifying claims, recommendations, and configuration examples.</li>

            <h2 id="team-expertise">Our Team's Expertise</h2>

            <p>The quality of cybersecurity education is only as good as the expertise behind it. The MySecurity Scores editorial team brings together professionals with <strong>over 15 years of combined, hands-on experience</strong> across the most critical domains of cybersecurity. Our team's backgrounds span the defensive and offensive sides of the security spectrum, giving us the breadth of perspective necessary to create content that addresses real-world threats and practical defensive strategies.</p>

            <p>Our team includes professionals who have served in <strong>Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst roles</strong>, where they monitored enterprise networks for threats, triaged security alerts, investigated incidents, and coordinated responses to active breaches. This operational experience informs our threat intelligence content and incident response guides, ensuring they reflect the realities of defending against attackers in real time rather than theoretical best-case scenarios. Our SOC experience spans organizations in financial services, healthcare, and technology sectors, giving us insight into the unique challenges each industry faces.</p>

            <p>We have team members with deep experience in <strong>compliance auditing</strong>, having conducted and supported audits for SOC 2 Type I and Type II, ISO 27001 certification, PCI DSS assessments, and HIPAA security rule evaluations. This firsthand knowledge of what auditors look for, what common deficiencies organizations exhibit, and what remediation strategies are most effective directly shapes our compliance guides. When we write about the gap between where most organizations start and where they need to be for certification, we are drawing on direct experience guiding organizations through that journey.</p>

            <p>Our team's expertise also includes <strong>penetration testing and vulnerability assessment</strong>. Team members have conducted authorized offensive security engagements against web applications, network infrastructure, wireless networks, and cloud environments. This offensive perspective is invaluable for creating content about defensive measures because it allows us to explain not just what controls to implement, but why specific controls matter and what happens when they are absent or misconfigured. Understanding how attackers think and operate makes our defensive recommendations more practical and more effective.</p>

            <p>Additional areas of expertise within our team include <strong>cloud security architecture</strong>, secure software development practices, identity and access management, cryptographic implementations, and security awareness training program development. This diverse skill set ensures that our content covers the full breadth of cybersecurity topics our readers need, and that each topic is addressed by someone with relevant, practical experience.</p>

            <!-- Section: Industry Recognition & Partnerships -->
            <h2 id="industry-recognition">Industry Recognition &amp; Partnerships</h2>

            <p>MySecurity Scores is committed to <strong>aligning our content and methodologies with the most respected frameworks and standards</strong> in the cybersecurity industry. While we are an independent educational platform, the frameworks and organizations we align with represent the gold standard in cybersecurity guidance, and maintaining fidelity to their principles is central to our credibility.</p>

            <p>Our security assessment methodologies are built on the <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</strong>, the most widely adopted cybersecurity framework in the United States and increasingly around the world. The CSF's five core functions, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, provide the organizational structure for our assessment tools and many of our educational guides. When NIST released CSF 2.0 with the addition of the Govern function, we updated our assessments and content to reflect the enhanced framework, ensuring our users always benefit from the latest guidance.</p>

            <p>Our web application security content draws heavily from the <strong>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</strong>, the preeminent open-source community dedicated to improving software security. Our application security guides reference the OWASP Top 10, the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), and the Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG). We follow OWASP's methodology for categorizing and prioritizing application security risks, ensuring consistency with the standard that most development teams and security professionals already use.</p>

            <p>For organizations seeking to implement prioritized, actionable security controls, our content references the <strong>CIS Controls</strong> (formerly the SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls), maintained by the Center for Internet Security. The CIS Controls provide a pragmatic, prioritized set of cybersecurity best practices that we frequently recommend as a starting point for organizations that find comprehensive frameworks like NIST or ISO 27001 overwhelming. We map our best practices recommendations to specific CIS Controls so readers can track their implementation progress against this widely recognized benchmark.</p>

            <p>Our threat intelligence content leverages the <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</strong>, the globally recognized knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures. By referencing ATT&amp;CK techniques in our threat intelligence reports and defensive guides, we provide readers with a common language for understanding threats and a structured way to evaluate whether their defenses address the techniques most commonly used by the adversaries relevant to their industry and region.</p>

            <!-- Section: Our Values -->
            <h2 id="our-values">Our Values</h2>

            <p>Everything we do at MySecurity Scores is guided by a core set of values that reflect our commitment to serving our readers and the broader cybersecurity community. These values are not marketing slogans; they are the principles that drive our editorial decisions, shape our content strategy, and define how we interact with our audience.</p>

            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p><strong>Accuracy is non-negotiable.</strong> In cybersecurity, incorrect information can lead to misconfigured systems, false senses of security, and ultimately, successful attacks that could have been prevented. Every claim we make is verified against authoritative sources. Every configuration example is tested. Every recommendation is evaluated for technical soundness. When we make an error, we correct it promptly and transparently, noting the correction in the updated content. We would rather delay publishing a guide than release one with unverified information.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p><strong>Security knowledge should be accessible to everyone.</strong> We reject the notion that cybersecurity education must be gatekept behind expensive certifications, consultant fees, or impenetrable jargon. Our content is written to be understood by intelligent professionals who may not have specialized security backgrounds. We explain technical concepts in clear language, provide context for acronyms and terminology, and structure our guides so that readers can find the information they need without wading through irrelevant detail. Accessibility also means keeping our core content free and ensuring our website is usable on any device.</p>

            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <p><strong>Our recommendations serve our readers, not our advertisers.</strong> Editorial independence is the foundation of trust, and trust is the most valuable asset an educational platform can have. We do not allow commercial relationships to influence our technical recommendations. Our security assessments and guides evaluate practices, frameworks, and approaches on their merits, based on evidence and alignment with industry standards. This independence ensures that when a reader follows our guidance, they can be confident it reflects genuine best practices rather than vendor marketing.</p>

            <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>The cybersecurity landscape never stands still, and neither do we.</strong> Threats evolve, frameworks are updated, new attack techniques emerge, and defensive technologies advance. We are committed to continuous learning and continuous improvement of our content. Our quarterly review cycle ensures that our guides reflect the current state of the art, not the state of the art when they were first written. We actively monitor threat feeds, framework updates, and industry research to identify when our content needs revision. We also invest in our own team's professional development, ensuring our expertise keeps pace with the industry.</p>

            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p><strong>We are open about our methods, our sources, and our limitations.</strong> Every guide on MySecurity Scores cites the frameworks and sources it draws from, so readers can verify our claims and explore topics in greater depth. We include last-updated dates on all content so readers know how current the information is. When a topic falls outside our area of expertise or when a situation requires professional consultation, we say so directly rather than overstepping our competence. Transparency builds trust, and trust is essential for an educational platform to fulfill its mission.</p>

            <!-- Section: Milestones & Growth -->
            <h2 id="milestones">Milestones &amp; Growth</h2>

            <p>MySecurity Scores has grown steadily since its founding, driven by a commitment to quality content and genuine value for our readers. Our journey reflects a deliberate, quality-first approach to growth, where each new initiative builds on the foundation established by the ones before it.</p>

            <h3>2024: Foundation and Launch</h3>
            <p>MySecurity Scores was <strong>founded in 2024</strong> with a clear mission: to create the cybersecurity education resource we wished had existed when we were helping small businesses navigate their security challenges. Our initial launch focused on a core set of security guides covering the fundamentals that every business needs to understand, including website security basics, SSL/TLS implementation, and an introduction to compliance frameworks. During this foundational year, we established our editorial standards, defined our content creation process, and built the infrastructure to support a growing library of resources. The response from the cybersecurity community and the businesses we aimed to serve validated our hypothesis that there was a significant gap in accessible, high-quality cybersecurity education.</p>

            <h3>2025: Assessment Tools and Expanded Coverage</h3>
            <p>In 2025, we <strong>launched our suite of interactive security assessment tools</strong>, marking a significant evolution from a content-only platform to an interactive educational resource. Our security assessment tools allow users to evaluate their security posture across multiple dimensions and receive prioritized, actionable recommendations. We also expanded our content library significantly during this period, adding in-depth guides on compliance frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS, as well as comprehensive resources on threat intelligence, incident response planning, and cloud security. Our best practices library grew to cover email security, password policies, access management, and network segmentation. By the end of 2025, we had published over 40 comprehensive guides, each peer-reviewed and aligned with industry frameworks.</p>

            <h3>2026: Compliance Guides and Community Growth</h3>
            <p>In 2026, we <strong>expanded our compliance coverage</strong> to address the growing demand from organizations navigating an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. We added detailed guides for GDPR compliance, HIPAA security requirements, and emerging state-level privacy regulations. We also deepened our threat intelligence capabilities, publishing regular briefings on ransomware trends, supply chain attack vectors, and AI-powered threats. Our interactive tools expanded to include a cloud security configuration checker and an enhanced password security analyzer. Community engagement became a major focus, with the launch of free resource downloads, open-source security tool contributions, and partnerships with educational institutions to bring cybersecurity awareness to the next generation of IT professionals.</p>

            <!-- Section: Community Engagement -->
            <h2 id="community">Community Engagement</h2>

            <p>MySecurity Scores is more than a content platform; we are an active member of the <strong>cybersecurity community</strong>, and we believe in giving back to the ecosystem that makes our work possible. Our community engagement efforts reflect our values of accessibility, transparency, and continuous learning.</p>

            <p>Our most significant contribution to the community is our <strong>library of free resources</strong>. Every guide, assessment tool, and educational resource on our platform is available at no cost. We do not gate our best content behind paywalls or require email addresses to access our guides. We believe that when cybersecurity knowledge is freely shared, the entire digital ecosystem benefits. A small business that implements proper email authentication because of our free guide is one fewer potential target for phishing campaigns that could affect their customers, partners, and the broader internet.</p>

            <p>We actively contribute to the <strong>open-source security community</strong> by developing and sharing tools, templates, and resources that other educators and security professionals can use and build upon. Our incident response plan templates, security policy frameworks, and assessment checklists are designed to be adapted and customized by organizations of any size. We release these resources under permissive licenses because we believe that standardizing and sharing security best practices accelerates improvement across the entire industry.</p>

            <p>We also engage with the cybersecurity community through <strong>educational outreach</strong>. We partner with small business associations and industry groups to deliver cybersecurity awareness content tailored to their members' needs. We contribute to public discussions about cybersecurity policy, responsible disclosure, and the importance of security education in reducing the impact of cybercrime. Our goal is to raise the baseline level of cybersecurity awareness across the business community, because improving security at any single organization strengthens the security of every organization connected to it.</p>

            <p>Looking ahead, we are committed to expanding our community engagement through more interactive formats, including webinar-style educational sessions, community-driven content suggestions, and collaborative projects that bring together security professionals and the businesses they serve. We believe that the most effective cybersecurity education is not a one-way broadcast but a conversation, and we are invested in building the platforms and relationships that make that conversation possible.</p>
